## Presentation
_Goodfood_ sells three different menus: _Earth_, _Surprise_ and _BlueLake_. It uses four different types of ingredients to produce the menus: _Pasta_, _Rice_, _Vegetable_ and _Fish_. A key component for a succesful business is to have an appropriate stock management. In ordre to know the quantities for each type of menu that have to be prepared each week, historical data from a similar food truck is provided [here](https://cyberlearn.hes-so.ch/mod/resource/view.php?id=8943). The futur number of menus sold at HealthyFood is suppose to be similar.  

The historical data of Goodfood comprises twelve variables:    
* *day*: The dates in the format 'yyyy-mm-dd'.   
* *week_day*: The day of the week.   
* *max_temp*: The daily maximal temperature in degrees Celsius.   
* *min_temp*: The daily minimal temperature in degrees Celsius.   
* *rainfall*: The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm.   
* *wind*: Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 20 minutes prior to noon.    
* *location*: Four different locations.   
* *passerby*: An estimation of the number of person who pass by the food truck in circa 50 meters around.   
* *revenue*: The daily total revenue in hundreds (for all menus/beverages).   
* *Surprise*: The amount of _Surprise_ menu sold.   
* *Earth*: The amount of _Earth_ menu sold.   
* *BlueLake*: The amount of _BlueLake_ menu sold.
