# Introduction: Multivariate regression
<div id="ex1">
**Exercise 1:** You receive the data on the *Height* and *Weight* of some women aged between 30 to 39
1. Load the data in `R` using the command `data(women)`. (The dataset is also available in *.csv on (on [cyberlearn](https://cyberlearn.hes-so.ch/mod/folder/view.php?id=721591))).      
2. Read the description of this dataset by running the command `?women`.   
3. Using the commands seen in the course, plot the *Height* against the *Weight*.   
4. You are interested in explaining the *Weight* by the *Height*. Write the regression equation.   
5. Fit a regression model using the `lm(.)` function.   
6. From the `summary(.)` of this linear regression, write the estimated model.   
7. Suppose you observe a new women who measures 1.73 meters, predict her *Weight*.  
(For the last point, you may want to use the `grid` package).

# Descriptive analysis
<div id=ex2>
**Exercise 2:** Use the `ski.csv` dataset available on  [cyberlearn](https://cyberlearn.hes-so.ch/mod/folder/view.php?id=721591).  
1. Load the dataset in `R`. First set the working directory (where you want to work with `R` in your computer) by using the `setwd("my directory")` commands. Then load the dataset using the command `ski <- read.csv(file="ski.csv", header=TRUE, sep=";")`.   
2. Produce multiple boxplots.   
3. Produce a scatterplot and add the regression line and confidence interval (use the code of **Example 1** in the Introduction).   
4. Compute the linear and Spearman's correlations. Is there any outliers effect on the correlation?   
5. Fit the linear regression of *Tickets* explaines by *Temperature*.   
6. Write the estimated regression equation.   
7. With this model, predict the number of tickets that will be sold for a temperature of -2.5 degrees.

# Inference
<div id="ex3">
**Exercise 3:** In motherhood, waiting times between the birth and the exit of 44 mothers were measured. Use the `hosptial.csv` dataset available on  [cyberlearn](https://cyberlearn.hes-so.ch/mod/folder/view.php?id=721591).  
1. Load the dataset in `R`. First set the working directory (where you want to work with `R` in your computer) by using the `setwd("my directory")` commands. Then load the dataset using the command `hospital <- read.csv(file="hospital.csv", header=TRUE, sep=";")`.   
2. Construct a confidence interval at a confidence level of 95\% for the average waiting time assuming the standard deviation is 1.   
3. Same as 2, but with an estimate of the standard deviation.  
4. Restart points 2 and 3 with a confidence level at 90\%, but before, do you expect the confidence intervals will be shorter or longer?
