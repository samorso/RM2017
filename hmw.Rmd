# Introduction: Multivariate regression
<div id="ex1">
**Exercise 1:** You receive the data on the *Height* and *Weight* of some women aged between 30 to 39
1. Load the data in `R` using the command `data(women)`. (The dataset is also available in *.csv on Cyberlearn).      
2. Read the description of this dataset by running the command `?women`.   
3. Using the commands seen in the course, plot the *Height* against the *Weight*.   
4. You are interested in explaining the *Weight* by the *Height*. Write the regression equation.   
5. Fit a regression model using the `lm(.)` function.   
6. From the `summary(.)` of this linear regression, write the estimated model.   
7. Suppose you observe a new women who measures 1.73 meters, predict her *Weight*.  
(For the last point, you may want to use the `grid` package).
