# Before we get started
### Formalities

### Few more wo`R`ds

# Introduction: Multivariate regression
### Preambule

### From mathematics to statistics

### Formalization

### Case study: how much is the car worth?

# Descriptive analysis

### Application to regression: variable of interest

### Application to regression: continuous predictors

### Application to regression: discrete predictors

# Inference

## Estimation by intervals

#### Application to regression: confidence interval on a coefficient

## Hypothesis testing

### Hypothesis

### Decision rule

### Test on a single mean

#### Application to regression: test on a single coefficient

### Test on two averages

#### Two populations

#### One population, two different situations

### ANOVA

### Multiple pairwise comparison

### Some practical recommendations
