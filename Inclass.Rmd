# Before we get started
<div id="ex1">
**Exercise 1:** Install `R` and `RStudio` on your personal laptop and reproduce the same code as in this subsection of the course.
</div>

# Introduction: Multivariate regression
<div id="ex2">
**Exercice 2:** Reproduce the same lines of code as **Example 1** on your laptop.
</div>

<div id="ex3">
**Exercice 3:** By helping yourself with the previous examples, explaine the *Price* (variable of interest) by the *Mileage* (predictor):   
1. Write the regression equation.   
2. Fit the regression using the `lm(.)` function.   
3. Using the `summary(.)` function, write the estimated regression equation.   
4. You observe a new car with mileage equals to 32500. Predict the price value.  
</div>

# Descriptive analysis
<div id="ex4">
**Exercise 4:** The dataset `marathon.csv` (on [cyberlearn](https://cyberlearn.hes-so.ch/mod/folder/view.php?id=721591)) contains a sample of time (minutes) at marathon of Boston [Keller].   
1. Load the dataset in `R`. First set the working directory (where you want to work with `R` in your computer) by using the `setwd("my directory")` commands. Then load the dataset using the command `marathon <- read.csv(file="marathon.csv", header=TRUE, sep=";")`.   
2. Compute the average, the standard deviation and the 5-number-summary.  
3. Make the boxplot of the data. What are the outliers?   
4. Build the histogram of the data. Describe the shape of the distribution? Determine approximately the mode of the distribution.   
</div>

<div id="ex5">
**Exercise 5:** The dataset `fastfood.csv` (on [cyberlearn](https://cyberlearn.hes-so.ch/mod/folder/view.php?id=721591)) contains measures of times in second of services at several drives.   
1. Load the dataset in `R`. First set the working directory (where you want to work with `R` in your computer) by using the `setwd("my directory")` commands. Then load the dataset using the command `fastfood <- read.csv(file="fastfood.csv", header=TRUE, sep=";")`.  
2. Produce a barplot illustrating the number of measures per drives.   
3. Produce a boxplot per drive.   
4. Produce a scatterplot between drives.  
5. Compute the linear and Spearman's correlations between the drives, use the function `cor(.)` and `cor( . , method = "spearman")`.
