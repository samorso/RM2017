# Before we get started
<div id="ex1">
**Exercise 1:** Install `R` and `RStudio` on your personal laptop and reproduce the same code as in this subsection of the course.
</div>

# Introduction: Multivariate regression
<div id="ex2">
**Exercice 2:** Reproduce the same lines of code as **Example 1** on your laptop.
</div>

<div id="ex3">
**Exercice 3:** By helping yourself with the previous examples, explaine the *Price* (variable of interest) by the *Mileage* (predictor):   
1. Write the regression equation.   
2. Fit the regression using the `lm(.)` function.   
3. Using the `summary(.)` function, write the estimated regression equation.   
4. You observe a new car with mileage equals to 32500. Predict the price value.
